# Practice React App

In this project we will practice the following things: 

* Passing `Props` to access data or use methods in other components
* Reusing `functional components` to clean up the code
* Binding methods to set the `this` context
* `Destructuring` objects to make our code cleaner
* Making deep copies of objects and arrays, to avoid mutating state directly
* Using different `event handlers` to allow for user interaction with the website
* Using the `findIndex` array method, to remove an object from an array based on a unique `id` property
